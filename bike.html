      <p>V-twin or L-twin</p>
      <p>V-twin engine. A two-cylinder engine with its cylinders aligned in two banks radiating out from the crankshaft, forming a V angle, is called a V-twin.</p>
      <p>L-twin.The Ducati V-twin has the V tilted forward, so the front cylinder is nearly parallel to the ground, hence
        the term L-twin.</p>

      <p>Two-valve engines
        Ducati engineer, Fabio Taglioni, once said that when they started building the plain bearing crank, belt-driven camshaft engines, instead of the old ball bearing crank, bevel geared shaft drive camshaft engines, he had gone from making
        complex
        engines to making simple ones.</p>

      <p>Multivalve models. From 1987 there have also been Ducati multivalve motorcycles.</p>

      <p>Ducati is a group of companies, best known for manufacturing motorcycles and headquartered in Borgo Panigale, Bologna, Italy.
        The group is owned by German automotive manufacturer Audi through its Italian subsidiary Lamborghini, which is in turn owned by the Volkswagen Group.</p>

      <p>The group currently comprises four companies:
        Ducati Motor Holding, a motorcycle-manufacturing division previously known as Ducati Meccanica.</p>
      <p>Ducati Corse, which runs the Ducati motorcycle racing program and is wholly owned by Ducati Motor Holding.</p>
      <p>Ducati Energia, formerly known as Ducati Elettronica, a designer and manufacturer of electrical and electronic components and systems</p>
      <p>Ducati Sistemi, a subsidiary of Ducati Energia, which provides electronic and information-technology products for road transport, railway transport,
        and transport automation applications.</p>
      <p>In the 1930s and 1940s, Ducati manufactured radios, cameras, and electrical products such as razors.</p>
      <p>Ducati also made a marine binocular called the BIMAR for the Kriegsmarine during World War II, some of which were sold on the civilian market after the war.
        The Ducati Sogno was a half-frame Leica-like camera which is now a collector's item. Ducati and Bianchi have developed and launched a new line of racing bicycles.</p>
      <p>Ducati Motor Holding often uses electrical components and subsystems from Ducati Energia</p>
